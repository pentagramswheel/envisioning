## Summary
Envisioning is a hypothetical startup and model that could predict another company's performance based on a multitude of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, instead of basing their performance on the average online review. The machine learning model used to evaluate a company across the ESG factors is trained on data collected and built by the startup.

The vision and potential results using some companies based in the U.S. can be found on <medium><a href='https://loier13.github.io/envisioning.github.io/'>this website hosted on GitHub</a></medium>.

While results were found, this project was the result of nearly 4 months of work, alongside four students' university schedules. Given more time, we know that the model and results could have been improved, among other products of our workflow.

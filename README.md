## Summary
Envisioning is a hypothetical startup and model that could predict another company's performance based on a multitude of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors, instead of basing their performance on the average online review. The machine learning model used to evaluate a company across the ESG factors is trained on data collected and built by the startup, where we predicted results using <medium><a href='https://github.com/pentagramswheel/envisioning/blob/main/classifier-and-sentiment/review_classifier_BERT.ipynb'>BERT</a></medium> and <medium><a href='https://h2o.ai/'>H2O.ai</a></medium>.

The vision and potential results using some companies based in the U.S. can be found on <medium><a href='https://loier13.github.io/envisioning.github.io/'>this website hosted on GitHub</a></medium>.

While results were found, this project was the result of nearly 4 months of work, alongside five students' university schedules. Given more time, we know that the model and results could have been improved, among other products of our workflow.
